        If you have a component that you want to conditionally show on a
        page and don't want to duplicate the logic between the view and the
        template (because you really shouldn't /want/ to do that) you should
        use `has_components` which is basically a dictionary with
        `component_key`s as the keys and `True` as the values for only those
        `component_key`s that are also in the `components` dict.

    {% if has_component.step_7_listing %}
        <div class="cmp" id="cmp_step_7_listing_id">
            {{ components.step_7_listing }}
        </div>
    {% endif %}

    <div class="cmp" id="cmp_step_9_attendance_entry_id">
        {{ components.step_9_attendance_entry }}
    </div>
